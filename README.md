# My Journey So Far...

I graduated back in 2015, and like many others, I thought of trying for government exams. To support myself during the prep, I started tutoring and to my surprise, it picked up really really well. I genuinely enjoyed teaching, and since it was financially rewarding too, I continued it until 2021. But then because of the pandemic hit, many of my students dropped off, and that’s when I decided to shift gears and go for a more stable option. I prepared for banking services and eventually cracked the SBI Junior Associate exam. I got posted in Pratapgarh in 2023. However, after spending about 9–10 months there, I realized two things: first, the work felt quite mundane, and second, I was actually doing better financially as a tutor since I didn't have to pay bills like rent and stuff at home. So, I made the choice to return to tutoring. And this is where it gets interesting. After I left SBI, I found myself in that classic ‘what's next?’ phase and much after constantly going back and forth, trying to figure out what truly interests me. Funny thing is, I had always believed that anything technical or coding-related just wasn’t my thing. But then, purely by chance, I stumbled upon a free Python course on YouTube. It jumped straight into the coding screen with some simple explanations, and I thought why not give it a shot? Next thing I know, three hours had flown by and I was completely hooked. It just clicked with me in a way I never expected. That moment kind of changed everything, I knew I wanted to dive deeper. So since then, I’ve been preparing seriously, upskilling myself… and here I am now, applying for data roles, excited for what’s ahead!
